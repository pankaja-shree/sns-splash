			<h1 class = "content-header">Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>
			This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.
			</p>
			
			<p><h3 class = "content-header">1. Collection of Information</h3>
			We do not collect any information you pass to the SNS Slack commands, nor any Slack messages in your Slack channels. We only require about the private channel-name and its topic in your team, your Slack username and your Slack team name to store in our database for better user experience. We do not use cookies or any other technologies to track users in any way. Use of the SNS Slack command is completely free of charge and no emails are sent from the bot.
			</p>
			
			<p><h3 class = "content-header">2. Links to Other Web Sites</h3>
			Our app and website does not include links to other websites other than the Slack authorization page, whose privacy policy may differ from ours. If you submit personal information to that site, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
